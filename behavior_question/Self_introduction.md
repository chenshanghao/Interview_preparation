# 1. Self-introduction
I recently graduated from Simon Fraser University with a master degree in Computing Science. 

During my last two semesters, I was doing data science related co-op at CopperTree Analytics.  I mainly did two projects in CopperTree. The first one is about time series data clustering for about 2000 trend logs. The second one is multi-variant anomaly detection module based on LSTM developed by PyTorch. This module can find the potential anomaly trend logs in a building child system like VAV or AHU. 

Before I came to Canada, I worked as a data engineer intern in Cisco for one year. My main job is ETL and analysis the WebEx meeting data. 

My primary language is Python and I have experience in Hadoop, SQL, Machine learning and Deep learning. I am very interested in the role of [xxx] at your company.
